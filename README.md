# Biodiversity Analysis

In this challenge, we build visualisation tools for data gathered on bacterial colonies grown from samples taken of belly buttons. You can select which sample you would like to look at from, and see the results of that sample's growth summarized in a bar chart as well as a bubble chart, with a guage indicating the washing frequency of the belly button in question.
